This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
source('~/Dropbox/Research/yale/causality_primer/lib/lingan/pwling.R')

system.time(orientations.detected <- sapply(1:5, function(i) {
  cat("\nmethod", i, "\n")
  dirmat <- pwling(t(ts), i)
  tpr <- mean(sign(upper(dirmat)[upper(net)!=0]) == 1)
  fpr <- mean(sign(upper(dirmat)[upper(net)==0]) == 1)
  c(tpr=tpr, fpr=fpr)
}))

colnames(orientations.detected) <- c("EB", "Tanh", "Skew", "RSkew", "DBSkew")
round(orientations.detected,2)*100
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
